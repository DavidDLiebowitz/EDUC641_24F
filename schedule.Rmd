**Note: readings are intended to be completed *after* subject is covered by class lecture; however, you are welcome to read them in advance. You are encouraged to preview the slides prior to that unit's lectures.**

*We have provided the lecture slides in .html and .pdf format. Some of the slide features will only work in .html format while connected to the internet. Feel free to download the PDFs for later use (you'll miss out on animations and interactivities, but most information will render correctly).*

## Unit 3

**Topic: Summarizing and displaying continuous data**

Objectives:

- Describe and summarize quantitative data that are continuous

- Descripe the purpose and compute the following measures of variability: quartiles, inter-quartile range, range, variance and standard deviation
  + Describe conceptually the principles of skewness and kurtosis
- Create visualizations of quantitative data that are continuous using R
  + Includes constructing histograms, densities, stem-and-leaf, and box-and-whisker plots
- Construct a standardized or $z$-score and explain its substantive meaning
- Use a $z$-transformation to compare distributions, observations within distributions and interpret outlying values
- Describe special features of a normal (and standard normal) distribution
- Interpret a $z$-statistic table
- Describe the distribution of repeated sample statistics drawn from a population, how this relates to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and how this is informative to statistical hypothesis testing
- Determine whether the mean value of a sample is different than a defined population mean, both when the population standard deviation of the variable is known ( $z$-test) and when it is unknown (one-sample $t$-test)
