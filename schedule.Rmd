## Unit 3

**Topic: Summarizing and displaying continuous data**

Objectives:

- Describe and summarize quantitative data that are continuous
- Describe the purpose and compute the following measures of central tendency: mean, median and mode
- Descripe the purpose and compute the following measures of variability: quartiles, inter-quartile range, range, variance and standard deviation
  + Describe conceptually the principles of skewness and kurtosis
- Create visualizations of quantitative data that are continuous using R
  + Includes constructing histograms, densities, stem-and-leaf, and box-and-whisker plots
- Describe special features of a normal distribution
- Describe the distribution of repeated sample statistics drawn from a population, how this relates to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and how this is informative to statistical hypothesis testing
- Determine whether the mean value of a sample is different than a defined population value (when provided the *SD* of the variable, aka $Z$-test)
- Conduct one-sample $t$-tests
